Quite frankly, we knew we could do it better if we had the opportunity. We were right.</p>
              <p>That group of four is now 65 strong, and all are united in a vision to provide value-added and innovative engineering, combined with the most reliable service plans and the best customer support in the business. In the process, we’ve landed on lists like Entrepreneur Magazine's Hot 100 fastest growing companies, the Inc. 5000, and the Central Penn Business Journal’s 50 Fastest Growing Companies three years in a row. </p>
              <p class="redtext">We feel we fulfill the promise on these key ideas: </p>
              <p><span class="redtext">Innovation.</span> With us, you can expect smart thinking and greater value as your benefit. We started and will always be on the cutting edge of applied innovation, sustainability and efficiency. Embracing the latest and best technology doesn’t stop at the technical level, we want to find new ways of continually improving our brand of customer service. We harness the power of innovation to work for you.</p>
              <p><span class="redtext">Right.</span> You can expect your problem to be solved so you can rest easier. Dependability is a distinction that is earned and not claimed. We have proven our value in any number of situations because of our outstanding people and our thoughtful solutions. We weigh the energy efficiency of the system, the long-term maintenance cost, the materials and layout to develop the best possible solution. We treat you right and we do the job right.</p>
              <p><span class="redtext">Now<strong>.</strong></span> Being responsive to your needs means you can return to what makes you productive. Servicing your mechanical needs must happen on your schedule, not ours. Enginuity is responsive and nimble, and it starts at estimating and follows through at delivery, installation and on to service contracts. We are innovative and forward thinking, and we understand that while looking ahead is great, we need to and always will take care of you now. </p></td>
